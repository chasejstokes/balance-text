168,2,"I like the fact that it only takes a moment to see that something occurred right around the middle of 2000-2010. I dislike the fact that there isn't additional information explaining the jump and when it actually occurred. This makes it hard to know exactly what year it started and ended as there are no individual hashes denoting years. In the previous graph, it showcased the year of the spike on the graph, making it very easy to pinpoint. ","I like the fact that it showcases how drastic an increase there was within a short span of years. You can clearly see a tremendous jump in and around 2008 and it doesn't take a lot of studying to see how drastic it is. What I dislike about it is the fact that you have to take a lot of time lining things up to be sure what year is being discussed. Since there are hashes only at every ten years, it becomes a bit more difficult to see exactly what year the jump began without additional information and you can't tell because of that how much change there was from year to year to then see if there were any drastic additional jumps from 2008 to 2010. With that said, I think showcasing every year would lesson the impact of how drastic the jump was and the additional text on the side sort of makes up for it. ","This graph is excellent, there really isn't too much I dislike about it. It clearly explains why there was a steady increase in median household income and it goes on to showcase how much the spike was and the exact amount. In addition it denotes the average increase for each decade before that, denoting how intense the jump was during that two year period. In essence, it combines the information I liked in the previous graph and the additional information into one easy to read and understand graph. The only thing I dislike is that it doesn't note the exact years, but to be fair, saying it was a two year jump and 2010 is the end of the graph makes it easy to tell exactly when the jump started and ended. ","I like the fact that it clearly explains how income rose from one decade to the next. Unlike the previous graph, you get clear numbers which explain how the average over each decade changed and the exact amount of change from 2008 to 2010, something that wasn't clearly shown on the previous graph. In addition, it explains why the sudden spike occurred, given the reader an idea where to look for additional information and understanding. The only thing I can say I dislike about it is the fact that it too doesn't explain the year to year averages verses a ten year average, to give a person a better sense of if there were rises and falls during the ten year period. ",4,3,1,2,"The first graph shows all the important information and is easy to read and understand. I can quickly grasp what is being covered by looking at the graph and the additional information helps to support the graph despite the lack of year hash marks. I ranked the information second because it helps someone clearly understand what happened while also showcases the amount of jump. This allows the reader to easily visualize themselves what has occurred. Three was only slightly off as it simply needed to add the amount of increases. As for four, it was lacking a lot of information and it would be hard for most to understand exactly what was happening or being discussed without additional context. ",5,"This doesn't look any different from the previous graph in retrospect. As with the previous graph, I like that it showcases the gradual baseline as well as the spike and sharp decrease. I feel that it having medium hashes on the Axis would improve it a lot and I dislike the fact that months are not shown for each year, something that I forgot to mention in the previous entry. ","I really like the fact that it shows the gradual ups and downs during each year before the spike. You get a real sense of what the baseline was the few years before the spike and it helps a person to understand how drastic the increase was. More than that, it also showcases really well how drastic the fall in approval was shortly after that and onward through the rest of the years. With that said, I think that I dislike the fact that the reason for the spike isn't explained or discussed as I feel this would give a person a greater understanding of what is being discussed with the graph. ","While this adds a bit to the first graph, it doesn't really showcase anything new. I think anyone looking at it could see the steep decline and what they would need is an explanation as to why. Showing where the exact maximum is helps a lot when studying these types of graphs so I like that it is there. Something else I dislike is the lack of months for each year and the fact that there aren't additional hashes on the axis. ",3,2,1,"If I am being honest, none of these graphs showcase any information that I would like to be added. With that said, the ones that do showcase the peek and the decline are better then the baseline graph. I think the first graph showcases better when the decline begins and at what point, drawing better focus to it then the second graph. The last graph is missing these things and for that reason it is ranked last. I feel that while they all showcase a gradual baseline, a peek and a decline well, they are all lacking in additional hash marks on the axis and monthly separation of each month for each year that would really help the view getting a better sense of what's going on and when.

Chart four is a little bare and just looks like the information could use a label or two.",6,"This way of presenting the information is okay, as it's easy to absorb the trends of the information.  It would be nice to have 1-2 labels to point out the highlights of the information.",I like the way this chart shows the information because it shows trends in the information presented and also adds an important point to note in text.,I like the chart because it's visual and I can easily see the trends of the information.  The label's show significant points of information and chart still appears clean and uncluttered.,3,2,1,I like the top chart the best because it shows the information so I can clearly see the trends in the information without looking cluttered.  I also like because it shows two points of the information in text.,1,1,4,The number of immigrants rose to 2 million in 2020,The number of immigrants stayed fairly constant from 1960-2020.,,2,3,4,4,4,3,4,5,3,4,5,5,5,5,55 - 64,2 year degree,Few times a week,6,"News article (online),Infographics",,Every day,1,Once a week,3,"Social media,News (online or print),Scientific publications,Short stories,Manuals or instructions,Government reports",,

294,2,"While it technically contains the information it needs to, it feels too bare and lacking in context.  I can tell that it's mostly there to show a sudden increase in median household income compared to the past, along with when that generally happened and a rough estimate of by how much, but it just isn't providing enough to justify the use of a graph in my opinion.","It gets the general idea that it's trying to convey across, the sudden increase in median household income, but it feels a bit too lacking in detail to me.  While that could be cleared up with surrounding context, I don't feel like the graph itself would add all that much.","I like that it's fairly clear and easy to understand, but it is perhaps a bit too simplistic to achieve that.  I feel like everything this graph shows could be condensed into one relatively short sentence and would accomplish the same amount of understanding.  I am sure with surrounding context it would be fine, but it still doesn't actually add much on its own, so perhaps including more information about that 2008 spike would be beneficial.","While not the most visually appealing means of conveying the information, it is very effective.  It gets the entire idea to me using specific numbers and gives at least a little bit of context to the situation.  I would tend to prefer this over graphs that instead feel a bit too vague.",4,3,2,1,"For me it almost entirely comes down to how much information is given.  The text option is simply the most clear and informative option, while still being simple enough to grasp instantly.  The graph options all feel a bit too simplistic or lacking in information to varying extents.",9,"While it technically shows the information it needs to, the lack of context for the large spike on the graph itself makes it feel kind of pointless.  I would need to read some surrounding context to make sense of that spike, and in doing so I would no longer need the graph to understand what happened.","It feels a bit strange for the graph to attempt to explain the increase in attendance but not the steep fall off immediately after, and in general I think it could use just slightly more detail, but overall it still feels okay to me as a visual representation.","Overall I think it's okay.  I would typically like a little bit more detail or context within the scope of the graph itself to make it more useful on its own, but it at least conveys the idea it is trying to in an easy to understand way.",3,2,1,"It is purely down to the amount of detail.

295,5,There is no information that says why the approval rating spiked and then dropped.,"Annotating the word ""maximum"" does not help much in deciphering the chart. Sure, it is clear to see that the approval rating significantly dropped after it maxed out but it does not tell the person looking at the chart of the reasons.",It makes it very clear what happened to the approval rating after an event that happened.,"I like that each event is listed in the order that happened. Even though is well written, it is not as easy to paint a picture (or visualize) of what the approval rating looks like.",4,3,1,2,,7,I like that you can clearly see what the immigration numbers were between 1970 and 2010.,I like that it is very easy to read. By looking at the chart it is obvious that something changed in the late 1970's that lead to higher immigration.,I don't like that the reasons are not given as to why there were to peaks withing 10 years. Even just listing the policy that went into effect would help a lot in figuring out why the chart looks the way it does.,3,2,1,,5,3,4,The president approval rating peaked in mid 2017.,The chart depicts the president approval between 2015 and 2020.,The approval rating did not change much in the first 2 years.,5,3,4,4,4,3,5,3,5,5,5,4,4,4,25 - 34,High school graduate,Few times a month,4,"Job or career,Social media,News article (online),News media (e.g., television news),Scientific publications,Infographics",,Every day,1,Few times a week,2,"Job or career,Social media,News (online or print),Magazines,Short stories,Manuals or instructions",,
296,9,"I like that it's even less cluttered than the first chart.  But, again, there need to be more tick marks added on both axes to show more exact figures.  Also, three pieces of text need to be added conveying the reasons why the numbers of attendees keep rising and falling.  A second line in the visual should be added to show ticket price.","I like how the line in the visual allows you to get a visual representation of the declines and increases of attendance throughout the 20 years.  I like that the chart is not cluttered.  I don't like that there aren't more tick marks showing more exact attendance amounts and years.  For example, I want to see ""1K through 4K"" not just 5K.  And I want to see tick marks for every year, not just every 5 years.  Also, there needs to be two pieces of text added.  One piece of text should be inserted on the left of the chart, which should allude to the team's poor performance.  The second missing piece of text needs to go on the right side of the chart, and it needs to allude to the teams improved performance due to better team members and management.  Also, a 2nd line could be added to the visual which could show the ticket prices.",I like that this chart explains more about the reasons behind why attendance keeps rising and falling.  I like the gray arrows and the gray bar that have been added to the visual to aid in an understanding of the decreases/increases; I like the gray bar telling you where the 20K mark is.  The chart is too cluttered.  There needs to be a better way of presenting the information so that clutter is avoided.  It needs more tick marks; needs a line added for ticket price.  It also needs a reason behind the fall in ticket prices after the ticket deals -- the text should say:  ticket deals end.,"I like the anecdotal feeling of it.  This helps to make the information more relatable and less boring to read.  I like that concise reasons are given for each change in numbers.  I dislike that there isn't an accompanying chart.  A chart would give more exact figures and exact years/dates, and a chart would allow you to take in all of the information at once.  From a chart, you would get a visual overview of the information stated in the paragraph, and you would get an actual visual timeline.",4,3,2,1,,7,"I like that this chart is less cluttered, but there needs to be a way of adding information about WHY the rises and falls occurred:  What were the exact policies which caused the immigration-number changes?  Also, more colors could be added, and bolder text.",I like that the line in the visual gives you a good and dramatic overview of the rises and falls of immigration numbers.  I don't like that there are no reasons given for the rises and falls -- what were the exact changes in policy?,"I like that more text was added to let you know when the 2nd peak occurred as related to the first peak; but, again, I want to know which policies caused these fluctuations, including WHY immigration is higher in 82 versus 80.",3,2,1,,2,1,3,"From 1960 to 2010 median household incomes rose from $20,000 to $80,000.","Median household incomes rose more quickly from 2008 to 2010; whereas prior income increases, going back to 1960, rose more steadily.",Median household incomes tend to constantly rise over the years versus experiencing peaks and valleys.,4,3,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,6,5,5,6,45 - 54,4 year degree,Few times a month,4,"News article (online),News media (e.g., television news),Infographics",,Every day,1,Few times a week,2,"Social media,News (online or print),Books,Manuals or instructions",,
